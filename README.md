                                                 🧙‍♂️ File Compression Project

Welcome, fellow code wizard! ✨  
Ever stared at a monstrous file and thought, “Yikes, how do I tame this beast?”  
Well, grab your favorite hoodie and a cup of coffee, because this project is here to turn file giants into byte-sized kittens.

1.What’s This All About?

This repo is your sandbox for building a **file compression tool** that uses the legendary Huffman Coding algorithm.  
Why Huffman? Because it’s the Gandalf of data compression—wise, efficient, and just a little bit magical.

2.Why Should You Care?

- **Save Space:** More room for memes, games, and your next side project.
- **Speed Up Transfers:** Send files faster than your WiFi can say “ping!”

Happy compressing! 🪄
