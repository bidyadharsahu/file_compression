File Compression Project
This project is about building a file compression tool using Huffman Coding to reduce file sizes efficiently. It addresses the problem of large files consuming too much storage and slowing down sharing by making them lightweight and faster to transfer. I developed a web application where users can log in, upload files, and compress them. The backend implements Huffman coding for compression, while the frontend provides a smooth and user-friendly experience.
